## Sliding window
暴力枚举法其实也可以理解为一种滑动窗口，只不过由于两个for循环导致要把一个元素traversal n times, but in the sliding window, each element visited at most twice.
Basically, sliding window is also a two-pointers algorithm. The most important part of sliding windows is to control the starting pointer of the window， here we use while(sum>target) to control, every time sum larger than
the target, the starting pointer will move forward.

```cpp
while (sum >= s) {
                subLength = (j - i + 1); // 取子序列的长度
                result = result < subLength ? result : subLength;
                sum -= nums[i++]; // 这里体现出滑动窗口的精髓之处，不断变更i（子序列的起始位置）
            }
### Why it visited an element at most twice
they are two pointers moving to the ending, but in the brute force method, for each starting pointer it will compare n ending pointer, that is O(n^2) worst time running time.
